## 1. Project Goal

Many production tracking systems assume a significant degree of computer fluency, leaving non-technical workers struggling with advanced software. This project was born to **bridge that gap** by:

- **üîÑ Reducing Complexity**: An intuitive web interface where orders can simply be dragged between stages, eliminating the need for complicated menus.  
- **üîí Enhancing Visibility**: Workers see clear, üîπ color-coded cues for deadlines, and üé® icons that represent different item types or processes.  
- **üîì Ensuring Accessibility**: By hosting through Google Apps Script, the system is browser-based, removing installation hurdles and simplifying updates.

Ultimately, this system aims to **üåç democratize** production tracking, enabling team members at every skill level to collaborate effectively and reduce bottlenecks on the factory floor.

## 2. Overview

The Factory Production Tracking System integrates tightly with üìÉ Google Sheets, acting as both a **üî¨ database** (for storing order details) and a **‚åõ real-time data source** (automatically updating the web interface). Users can:

- Visualize orders and move them through custom production stages.  
- Search for specific items or view large sets of orders, emphasizing those with urgent deadlines.  
- Print out üóÉÔ∏è status reports for review, meetings, or archival purposes.

This design is flexible and can be easily adapted to various production workflows, making it suitable for small-scale factories, specialized workshops, or larger operations seeking a lightweight tracking solution.

## 3. Features

1. **üîß Drag-and-Drop Interface**  
   - Allows direct manipulation of orders across stages or sub-stages.  
   - Instant status updates are written back to üìÉ Google Sheets.

2. **üîπ Visual Alerts**  
   - üü•‚¨Ü‚¨á Color-coded date bubbles to indicate urgency or upcoming deadlines.  
   - Descriptive icons (e.g., üõë doors, üç≤ kitchen items) to help workers quickly identify order types.

3. **üîé Search & Filter**  
   - Users can type a keyword or order number in a search bar.  
   - Matching items become highlighted; others become dimmed for clarity.

4. **üé® Dynamic Stage Management**  
   - Reads main stages and sub-stages from a dedicated sheet (‚ÄòStages‚Äô) to accommodate changes with minimal code edits.

5. **üìÉ Automated Reporting**  
   - Generates a printable table of production status and dates, useful for daily or weekly progress reviews.

1. **Data Source**: All production order details and stage definitions reside in Google Sheets.  
2. **Apps Script**: Fetches or updates data in Sheets, then renders an interactive webpage.  
3. **Web Interface**: Users drag and drop orders into different production phases or sub-stages, triggering automatic updates.

## 7. Setup & Deployment

### Step 1: üìÉ Create or Upload the Sample Sheet

**Option 1: Download the Sample Sheet**  
- Download the sample Excel file: [Download Sample Production Sheet](#).  
- Open the file in your preferred spreadsheet application and review the data.

**Option 2: Create a New Sheet Manually**  
- Open a new Google Spreadsheet and create two tabs:  
  - `Stages`: Add the following columns:
    - Main Stage
    - Sub Stage
  - `Orders`: Add the following columns:
    - ID, Description, Date Received, Delivery Date, Status, Comments
- Populate the tabs with relevant data (you can reference the structure of the sample sheet for guidance).

**Upload the Sample Sheet to Google Sheets**  
- Open Google Drive, click **‚ûï New > File Upload**, and upload the sample Excel file.  
- Right-click the uploaded file and select **Open with > Google Sheets**.

### Step 2: üîç Retrieve the Spreadsheet ID

1. Open the Google Sheet you just created or uploaded.  
2. Look at the URL in your browser. It will look like this:  
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit
   ```
3. Copy the long alphanumeric string between `/d/` and `/edit`. This is your **Spreadsheet ID**.

### Step 3: üîß Deploy the Script

1. Open the **Google Apps Script Editor**:  
   - From your Google Sheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.
2. Copy the script files (`Code.gs`, `Utilities.gs`, etc.) into the Apps Script Editor.
3. Set up your Spreadsheet ID:  
   - Open the `Utilities.gs` file and locate the `setSpreadsheetId()` function.
   - Replace the placeholder ID with your actual Spreadsheet ID:
     ```javascript
     scriptProperties.setProperty('SPREADSHEET_ID', 'your_spreadsheet_id_here');
     ```
   - Run the `setSpreadsheetId()` function to store the ID.
4. Save and deploy your script:  
   - Click **Deploy > New Deployment > Web App**.  
   - Set `Execute as` to **Me** and `Who has access` to **Anyone with the link**.  
   - Copy the deployment URL for later use.

### Step 4: üîß Test the App

- Open the deployment link, confirm that the production orders load correctly, and check that dragging any item updates the Google Sheet.

## 8. Usage Instructions

1. **üåê Access the Web Link**  
   - Share the deployment URL with factory team members, or place it on a shared workstation.  
2. **üîß Order Manipulation**  
   - Each production stage is displayed in a separate box.  
   - Drag an order to a new stage to reflect its progress. The system automatically updates the spreadsheet.  
3. **üîé Search Bar**  
   - Enter a PO number, WO number, or keyword from the description. Items that match are highlighted; all others appear dimmed.  
4. **üìÉ Reporting**  
   - Use the **Print** button to open a printable page summarizing relevant orders, which can then be printed or saved.

---

## 9. Customization

- **üé® Stages and Sub-Stages**  
  - Modify rows in the `Stages` sheet to introduce new phases or rename existing ones.  
- **üîé Icons**  
  - Extend the `getIconForDescription()` function to display additional emojis or icons.  
- **‚è≥ Date Thresholds**  
  - Adjust color-coding (e.g., üü• for items within 3 days of the deadline, üü° for within 14 days, etc.) in the script to match your workflow.  
- **üìÉ Data Columns**  
  - If new columns are added to the main sheet, update the associated indexing in the script.

## üìù Known Limitations

- **üîπ Google Apps Script Quotas**  
  - Large-scale factories with thousands of orders may approach daily execution or time quotas.  
- **üö´ Offline Access**  
  - Requires internet connectivity to interact with Google Sheets and the script.  


## 10. Known Limitations

- **Google Apps Script Quotas**  
  - Large-scale factories with thousands of orders may approach daily execution or time quotas.  
- **Offline Access**  
  - Requires internet connectivity to interact with Google Sheets and the script.  
- **Multi-Sheet Integrations**  
  - The system, as presented, focuses on a single main data source. Future integrations (e.g., multi-site production) would require additional script logic.
